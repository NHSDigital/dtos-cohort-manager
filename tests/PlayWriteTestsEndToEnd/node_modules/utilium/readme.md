- Debugging types and functions
- Utilities for using `fetch` with [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)

- Convenience types and functions for strings and objects
- RNG functions
- Ranged cache
- `List`, a class that combines the best aspects of `Set` and arrays
- `JSONFileMap` and `FolderMap`
- Version utilities
- Xterm.js shell handling (arrows, home/end, prompting, etc.)
