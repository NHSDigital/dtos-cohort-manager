# Test Files

This directory is used to store test files required for integration tests.

## Instructions

1. Place your CSV test files in this directory (ensuring that all test data is dummy data).
2. Ensure files are named correctly with the exact naming convention set out in the requirements and appropriate paths used in the tests.
3. Do not commit actual test files to the repository.

## Example

Place your valid csv file with test/dummy data into tests/Integration/TestFiles before running a happy path test. Ensure the paths in your test match the actual path of your test files.
