TODO (SN-MessageType)

These validations currently evidence ServiceNow activity via ExceptionManagement only
using RuleDescriptionContains "servicenow". Once the ServiceNow WireMock is available,
add assertions to verify the ServiceNow message type (e.g., type 2) was sent for this
scenario and remove the @incomplete tag from the validations.
