# Cohort Manager UI

> Note: This repository will shortly be getting merged together with [https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-cohort-manager](https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-cohort-manager), which is why it doesn't use the repository template.

User interface for the Screening - Cohort Manager service (Team Select).

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [NHS CIS2 Authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication).

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) package manager

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file which should override environment variables required to run locally:

```text
# Default
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000
SERVICE_NAME="Cohort Manager"

# Next Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://localhost:3000/api/auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET={RANDOM_SECRET_STRING}

# API
EXCEPTIONS_API_URL=https://localhost:3000

# Cohort Manager users UIDs
COHORT_MANAGER_USERS=uid1,testuid

# CIS2 Auth - only required if using CIS2 in dev
AUTH_CIS2_ISSUER=https://am.nhsint.auth-ptl.cis2.spineservices.nhs.uk
AUTH_CIS2_CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
AUTH_CIS2_CLIENT_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}

# Only required for hosted environments
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
```

For `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or [https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) to generate a random value.

### Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies using

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:secure
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

#### Running unit tests

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

This will execute all unit tests and provide a summary of the tests results.

#### Running unit tests in watch mode

To run the unit tests in watch mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:unit:watch
```

This will run the tests and re-run them whenever a file changes.

#### Coverage report

To generate a code coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

This will generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.

### End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Before running end-to-end tests make sure your development server is running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. Using the command `pnpm run dev`.

#### Running end-to-end tests

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

This will open the Playwright test runner, where you can run the tests interactively.

### Running end-to-end tests in headless mode

To run the end-to-end tests in headless mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This will run the tests in headless mode and output the results to the terminal.
